# From Figma to Live Website: Automation with Gemini CLI

This project demonstrates how a Figma design can be transformed into a live website and automatically deployed in seconds using the **Gemini Command Line Interface (CLI)** and its Multi-Capability Tools (MCPs).

## About The Project

This work aims to merge the design, code generation, version control, and deployment processes into a single, fluid, and automated workflow. Thanks to the powerful capabilities of the Gemini CLI, it showcases the transformation of an idea from design to a live product without the need for manual intervention.

## Technical Infrastructure and Workflow

The foundation of the project is the Gemini CLI and its MCPs, which can integrate and work with various platforms and services.

### Tools Used

*   **Gemini CLI:** The central interface where the entire process is managed and commands are executed.
*   **Figma MCP (`figma-mcp`):** The tool that enables Gemini to communicate with Figma.
    *   **Function:** It analyzes the Figma design link provided by the user, interprets design elements (colors, fonts, layout, images, etc.), and generates HTML and CSS code based on this information.
*   **GitHub MCP (`github-mcp`):** The tool that enables Gemini to interact with GitHub.
    *   **Function:** It automatically pushes all project files (HTML, CSS, images) generated by the `figma-mcp` to a specified GitHub repository.
*   **Netlify:** A continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) platform for modern web projects.
    *   **Function:** It connects to the GitHub repository, fetches the project, builds it, and deploys it to a live web address. Every new `push` to GitHub automatically triggers a site update.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Design Phase:** The project's user interface is prepared as a template on Figma.
2.  **Code Generation Phase:** The link to the Figma design is provided as input to the Gemini CLI. Gemini uses the `figma-mcp` to convert the design into code, creating the project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `images/` directory, etc.).
3.  **Version Control:** The generated local project files are pushed to the GitHub repository with a single command via the `github-mcp`.
4.  **Deployment:** Netlify instantly detects the new changes in the connected GitHub repository, pulls the project to its servers, builds it, and deploys it live within seconds.

## Conclusion

This project is a concrete example of how modern artificial intelligence tools like the Gemini CLI and MCPs can fundamentally change and automate software development and design processes. A concept created by a designer in Figma has been transformed into a globally accessible website in minutes, without the need for a developer's manual coding and deployment efforts.
